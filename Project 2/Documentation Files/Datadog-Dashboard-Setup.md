3. Click on the host you want to create a dashboard for. It will show you a default
	board that cannot be edited.
4. Click on the gear icon in the upper right corner and click Clone Dashboard, this
	will create a clone of the dashboard that can be edited.
5. To add metric graphs, click on the empty square with the words add a graph

Alternatively, if you want to start from scratch:
